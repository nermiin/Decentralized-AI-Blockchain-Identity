# Decentralized-AI-Blockchain-Identity

## Overview
A decentralized identity verification system designed to enhance security and user trust by integrating AI, Blockchain, and Cybersecurity technologies. This project aims to provide businesses with a scalable and robust identity management solution.


## Architecture

### Components
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on Ethereum for decentralized control.
- **AI Verification Engine**: Built with Python and TensorFlow.
- **API Gateway**: Built with .NET, serves as the bridge between Blockchain and AI components.
- **Front-end**: A simple UI built with React.

### Flow
1. **User Interaction**: The user initiates a request from the Front-end.
2. **API Gateway**: The request is passed to the API Gateway.
3. **Smart Contract**: A transaction is created on the Ethereum blockchain.
4. **AI Verification**: AI engine verifies the identity.
5. **Blockchain Update**: Smart Contract updates with verification results.
