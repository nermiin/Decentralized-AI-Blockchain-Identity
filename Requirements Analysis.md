### Requirements Analysis for Decentralized Identity Verification System

#### Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration**
    - Users should be able to register and create a digital identity.
    
2. **Identity Verification**
    - Verification process using AI algorithms to validate user-provided information.
    
3. **Blockchain Integration**
    - Record verified identities on a blockchain for immutability and trust.
    
4. **Smart Contracts**
    - Automated contracts to handle verification status and permissions.
  
5. **API Gateway**
    - A RESTful API to interact with the blockchain and AI engine.
  
6. **User Authentication**
    - Secure user login and JWT token issuance.

7. **Admin Dashboard**
    - A dashboard for administrators to oversee verification processes, user activity, and system health.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**
    - The system should handle a high number of verification requests.
  
2. **Security**
    - Implement end-to-end encryption and adhere to privacy standards like GDPR.
  
3. **Performance**
    - Verification should be processed in real-time or near-real-time.
  
4. **Usability**
    - Easy-to-use interface for both users and admins.

5. **Reliability**
    - High availability, fault tolerance, and data backup features.

#### Technical Requirements

1. **Tech Stack**
    - .NET for API, Python for AI engine, Solidity for smart contracts.

2. **Database**
    - Choose a reliable and scalable database like PostgreSQL.
  
3. **Hosting/Deployment**
    - Select the hosting platforms for each component based on budget and performance needs.
  
4. **Third-party Services**
    - APIs, libraries, or other services that the system will rely on.
